Checking whether a number is divisible by 3 or not , by the condition of not using '%' operator as "N%3"

Input : Giving a number N
output: Displays 'true' if the number is divisible by 3
        Displays 'false' if the number is not divisible by 3

Procedure:

1. START
2. Declare the variables n, sum, sum1, rem, x,y,z 
3. Give a number 'n' as an input
4. Assign sum=0
5. Assign rem=n
6. WHILE rem>0
        assign x=rem%10
        assign rem=rem/10
        assign sum=sum+x
7. IF
   sum==3 or sum==6 or sum==9
   print"entered number is divisible by 3 and true"
8.  ELSE IF 
    sum<=9
print "entered number is not idvisible by 3 and false"
9.  ELSE
    assign y=sum
    assign sum1=0
10. WHILE
   assign z=y%10
   assign y=y/10
   assign sum1=sum1+z
11.IF
   sum1==3 or sum1==6 or sum1==9
   print "given number is divisible by 3 and true"
12.ELSE
   print "given number is not divisible by 3 and false"
13.END
