Program for finding Nth fibonacci number of given limit

Input:  Give a number N
Output: Nth fibonacci number 

Procedure:

1.START
2.Declare the variable N as integer
3.Declare the variable terms prev, curr, next as integers       (prev= previous term, curr= current term, next= next term)
4.Declare i as an integer   
5.Give muber N as input 
6.Assign prev=0
7.Assign curr=1
8.Assign i=0
9.FOR n>i (i=1 to n)
      assign next=prev+current
      assign prev=curr
      assign curr=next
10.perform i=i+1
11.display 'next' as the nth fibonacci number of that series 
12.END
